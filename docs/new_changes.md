## 1. LLM Model Switch: Qwen 2.5-3B -> Gemma 4 E2B

### Why

The previous model (Qwen 2.5-3B-Instruct Q4_K_M) was chosen when the system was documented as having 8GB shared memory. The Jetson Orin NX actually has 16GB LPDDR5 (102.4 GB/s bandwidth), which allows a larger, more capable model. Google's Gemma 4 E2B (released April 2, 2026) is edge-optimised with Per-Layer Embeddings and supports multimodal (image + text) input.

### Model Comparison

| | Qwen 2.5-3B (Previous) | Gemma 4 E2B (New) |
|---|---|---|
| Parameters | 3B | 5.1B total, 2.3B active |
| Architecture | Dense transformer | Per-Layer Embeddings (edge-optimised) |
| Quantisation | Q4_K_M GGUF | Q4_K_M GGUF |
| File size | ~2.0 GB | ~2.9 GiB (~3.1 GB) |
| VRAM usage | ~2 GB | ~3.1 GB |
| Multimodal | Text only | Text + Image (with mmproj) |

### GPU Memory Budget (16GB Jetson Orin NX)

| Component | Previous | Now (text only) | Now (with vision) |
|---|---|---|---|
| TensorRT action model | ~200MB | ~200MB | ~200MB |
| TensorRT YOLO pose | ~150MB | ~150MB | ~150MB |
| LLM model | ~2.0GB | ~3.1GB | ~3.1GB |
| Vision projector (mmproj) | N/A | 0 (not loaded) | ~1GB (lazy) |
| Frame buffers | ~100MB | ~100MB | ~100MB |
| **Total GPU** | **~2.5GB** | **~3.6GB** | **~4.6GB** |
| **Free remaining** | ~13.5GB | ~12.4GB | ~11.4GB |

### Critical: Jetson Performance Tuning

Gemma 4 E2B requires two specific parameters to run fast on Jetson:

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `flash_attn=True` | Enabled | Gemma 4 has variable-size V embeddings across layers. Without flash attention, llama.cpp pads all V caches to 512 dims, wasting memory and compute. Flash attention avoids this padding. |
| `n_threads=6` | All CPU cores | Gemma 4 uses Per-Layer Embeddings which places ~1.7GB of token embedding weights on CPU. With the default 1-2 threads, CPU-side compute is a bottleneck. Using all 6 Cortex-A78AE cores makes it fast. |

**Without these**: 0.3-0.5 tok/s (unusable). **With these**: 16-20 tok/s (100 tokens in ~5 seconds).

These are set in `llm_node.py` in the `_lazy_load_model()` method and in `tools/llm_chat_gui.py`.

### How to Switch Back

Edit `config/boxbunny.yaml` -- comment the Gemma line, uncomment the Qwen line:

```yaml
llm:
  # model_path: "models/llm/gemma-4-E2B-it-Q4_K_M.gguf"
  model_path: "models/llm/qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf"
```

Both model files remain on disk. The `llm_models.yaml` config also lists all available models for the chat GUI tool.

### Files Changed for Model Switch

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `config/boxbunny.yaml` | `model_path` switched to Gemma 4 E2B, old models listed as commented alternatives |
| `config/llm_models.yaml` | Added Gemma 4 E2B as default, kept Qwen models as alternatives |
| `src/boxbunny_core/boxbunny_core/config_loader.py` | Default `model_path` updated to Gemma 4 E2B |
| `src/boxbunny_core/launch/boxbunny_full.launch.py` | Model filename updated |
| `src/boxbunny_core/launch/boxbunny_dev.launch.py` | Model filename updated |
| `src/boxbunny_core/launch/headless.launch.py` | Model filename updated |
| `scripts/download_models.sh` | HF repo, filename, min size updated for Gemma 4 E2B; Qwen info kept as comment |
| `notebooks/scripts/test_llm.py` | MODEL_PATH updated |
| `notebooks/scripts/hardware_check.py` | LLM model path check updated |

| `docs/system/technical-deep-dive.md` | Model info table, GPU memory table, rationale text updated |
| `docs/system/architecture.md` | LLM node description updated |

### Dependency Change

llama-cpp-python upgraded from 0.3.19 to 0.3.20 to add Gemma 4 (`gemma4`) architecture support. Built from source with CUDA enabled:

```bash
export CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin/nvcc
CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin/nvcc" \
  pip3 install --upgrade llama-cpp-python==0.3.20 --no-cache-dir
```

---

## 2. Documentation Fix: Jetson Specs

The technical deep dive incorrectly listed the hardware as Jetson Orin NX 8GB with JetPack 5.x.

| Field | Was (Incorrect) | Now (Correct) |
|---|---|---|
| Model | Jetson Orin NX 8GB | Jetson Orin NX 16GB |
| RAM | 8GB LPDDR5 | 16GB LPDDR5 |
| OS | JetPack 5.x (Ubuntu 20.04 / L4T) | JetPack 6.2.1 (Ubuntu 22.04 / L4T) |

Fixed in `docs/system/technical-deep-dive.md` (5 locations).

## 3. Image Chat Feature (Phone Dashboard)

### Overview

Users can now send images alongside text messages in the phone dashboard chat. The Gemma 4 E2B model is multimodal (text + image), so it can answer questions about photos -- for example, identifying food and estimating calories, recognising sports equipment, or analysing a boxing stance from a photo.

### How It Works

```
User takes/selects photo on phone
        |
        v
Frontend compresses to 512px JPEG (0.8 quality)
        |
        v
POST /api/chat/message  { message: "...", image: "<base64>" }
        |
        v
Dashboard API passes image_base64 in context_json to ROS service
        |
        v
llm_node._handle_generate() detects image_base64 in context
        |
        v
Routes to _generate_with_image() instead of _generate()
        |
        v
_lazy_load_vision() loads mmproj-F16.gguf (ONLY on first image, ~1GB VRAM)
        |
        v
Multimodal inference via create_chat_completion with image_url content block
        |
        v
Response sent back through the same pipeline as text-only chat
```

### Performance Protection

The image feature is designed to NOT impact the robot's real-time performance:

1. **Lazy loading**: The vision projector (`mmproj-F16.gguf`, ~1GB) is only loaded into VRAM when the first image is sent. During normal text-only operation, it uses zero VRAM.

2. **Separate code paths**: Real-time coaching tips (`_tip_tick()`) always use `_generate()` (text-only). Image requests use `_generate_with_image()`. The two paths never cross.

3. **Separate timeouts**: Text-only inference has a 20-second timeout. Image inference has a 40-second timeout. Image processing cannot starve the coaching tips.

4. **CV inference is unaffected**: Computer vision (TensorRT action model, YOLO pose) runs in a separate process and is completely independent from LLM inference.

5. **No ROS service changes**: Image data is passed through the existing `context_json` string field as base64, so the GenerateLlm.srv definition is unchanged and backward compatible.

### New Model File

| File | Size | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `models/llm/mmproj-F16.gguf` | 940 MB | `unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF` on HuggingFace |

This is the multimodal projector that bridges the vision encoder to the language model. It is required for image processing but NOT for text-only operation.

### Files Changed for Image Chat

**Backend (LLM Node):**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/boxbunny_core/boxbunny_core/llm_node.py` | Added `_lazy_load_vision()` method to load mmproj on first image request. Added `_generate_with_image()` method with 40s timeout and multimodal message format. Modified `_handle_generate()` to detect `image_base64` in context_json and route to vision or text path. Added `mmproj_path` parameter and `IMAGE_INFERENCE_TIMEOUT_S` constant. |
| `src/boxbunny_core/boxbunny_core/config_loader.py` | Added `mmproj_path` field to `LLMConfig` dataclass |

**Backend (Dashboard API):**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/boxbunny_dashboard/boxbunny_dashboard/api/chat.py` | Added optional `image` field (base64 string) to `ChatRequest` model. Updated `_call_llm_sync()` and `_call_llm()` to accept and pass image data. Image requests get 45s ROS timeout vs 25s for text. Added image size validation (max 5MB). |

**Frontend (Vue Dashboard):**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/boxbunny_dashboard/frontend/src/views/ChatView.vue` | Added image picker button (gallery icon) next to text input. Added image preview bar with cancel button above input. Added `<img>` display in user message bubbles for attached images. Added `compressImage()` function (client-side resize to max 512px, JPEG quality 0.8). Added `onImageSelected()` and `clearImage()` handlers. Updated `handleSend()` to pass image alongside text. Send button enabled when image is attached even without text. |
| `src/boxbunny_dashboard/frontend/src/stores/chat.js` | `sendMessage()` now accepts optional `image` parameter. User messages include `image` field when present. Default prompt "What is in this image?" when image sent without text. |
| `src/boxbunny_dashboard/frontend/src/api/client.js` | `sendChatMessage()` now accepts optional `image` parameter and includes it in request body. |

**Configuration:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `config/boxbunny.yaml` | Added `mmproj_path: "models/llm/mmproj-F16.gguf"` to LLM section |

**Scripts:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `scripts/download_models.sh` | Added section 1b to download `mmproj-F16.gguf` from HuggingFace. Added mmproj status to summary output. |

**Documentation:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `docs/system/technical-deep-dive.md` | GPU memory table updated to show mmproj as conditionally loaded row. Added note about lazy loading. |
| `docs/system/architecture.md` | LLM node description updated to mention vision support and lazy loading. |

## 6. Chat Conversation Flow & Reply Depth

### Problem

The previous chat setup had several issues:
1. `max_tokens` was set to 128 for all requests (tips AND chat), causing chat replies to cut off mid-sentence
2. The system prompt was too rigid -- it always told the LLM to keep replies to "2-3 sentences max"
3. Drill suggestions were sometimes generated unprompted, cluttering casual conversation

### Changes

**Reply depth toggle** -- Users can now select Short / Normal / Detail in the chat header:

| Mode | Behaviour | Max tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Short | 1-2 sentences, straight to the point | 100 |
| Normal | 2-4 sentences, balanced | 256 |
| Detailed | In-depth with examples and breakdowns | 512 |

The toggle is a small segmented control in the chat header next to the info button.

**Separate token limits** -- Real-time coaching tips still use the config value (128 tokens, kept short for the robot screen). Chat requests from the dashboard get higher limits based on the depth setting, so responses finish naturally.

**Improved system prompt** -- The chat system prompt (`_build_system_prompt` in chat.py) was rewritten to:
- Be conversational and natural, matching the user's tone
- Only suggest drills when the user explicitly asks (with clear examples of what "asking" looks like)
- Always finish thoughts completely
- Use the user's name occasionally
- Handle image queries naturally

**Drill suggestion rules** -- The chat prompt now includes a "TRAINING DRILL SYSTEM" section with:
- Explicit trigger phrases the model recognises (e.g., "suggest a training", "suggest a drill", "give me a workout", "what should I practice")
- A concrete example of a correct response WITH a `[DRILL:]` tag so the model knows the exact format
- A concrete example of a response WITHOUT a tag so the model knows when to just talk
- Available combo numbers (1=jab, 2=cross, 3=L hook, etc.) so it can build custom combos
- Result: asking "suggest me a training" reliably generates drill cards, while normal conversation stays clean

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/boxbunny_core/boxbunny_core/llm_node.py` | Chat requests (`system_prompt_key == "coach_chat"`) get 100/256/512 max tokens based on depth. Tips unchanged at 128. Added "Always finish your sentences completely" to main system prompt. Uses dashboard's custom system prompt when provided. |
| `src/boxbunny_dashboard/boxbunny_dashboard/api/chat.py` | `_build_system_prompt()` rewritten with conversation style guidance, explicit drill rules with examples, reply depth instructions, and image query handling. Accepts `reply_depth` from context. |
| `src/boxbunny_dashboard/frontend/src/views/ChatView.vue` | Added reply depth toggle (Short/Normal/Detail) as segmented control in header. Passes depth to store. |
| `src/boxbunny_dashboard/frontend/src/stores/chat.js` | `sendMessage()` accepts `depth` parameter, passes it as `reply_depth` in context. |

## 7. Bug Fixes During Testing

### 7a. Gemma 4 E2B extremely slow inference (0.3 tok/s -> 20 tok/s)

**Problem**: Initial testing showed 0.3-0.5 tokens/second, making the model unusable. Gemma 4 E2B is designed for edge devices, so something was wrong.

**Root cause**: Two missing parameters in the Llama constructor:
1. Without `flash_attn=True`, llama.cpp pads all V caches to 512 dimensions because Gemma 4 has variable-size V embeddings across layers. This wastes memory and compute.
2. Without `n_threads=6`, only 1-2 CPU cores were used. Gemma 4's Per-Layer Embeddings place ~1.7GB of token embedding weights on CPU (`CPU_Mapped` buffer), making CPU thread count critical.

**Fix**: Added `flash_attn=True` and `n_threads=6` to `_lazy_load_model()` in `llm_node.py` and `tools/llm_chat_gui.py`.

**Result**: 16-20 tokens/second. 100 tokens in ~5 seconds.

### 7b. Image chat returning "I can't see images right now"

**Problem**: Sending an image through the dashboard chat resulted in the LLM saying it couldn't see the image, even though standalone testing worked.

**Root cause**: The vision `chat_handler` was being passed as a parameter to `create_chat_completion()`, but llama-cpp-python requires the handler to be set directly on the model instance (`model.chat_handler = handler`). The parameter-based approach silently fell back to text-only mode.

**Fix**: In `_generate_with_image()`, the handler is now set on the model before the call and unset after:
```python
self._llm.chat_handler = self._chat_handler
try:
    result = self._llm.create_chat_completion(...)
finally:
    self._llm.chat_handler = None
```
This ensures vision is active for image requests and inactive for text-only tips.

### 7c. Drill suggestion cards not appearing

**Problem**: Asking "suggest me a training" in the dashboard chat resulted in conversational advice but no `[DRILL:]` tag, so no clickable drill card appeared.

**Root cause**: The system prompt gave the model the tag format but didn't show a concrete example of a complete response with the tag. The model understood what `[DRILL:]` tags are but didn't know it should actually generate one when asked.

**Fix**: Rewrote the drill section of the system prompt to include:
- A "TRAINING DRILL SYSTEM" header explaining that the robot loads drills from tags
- Explicit trigger phrases the model should recognise
- A concrete example of a full response WITH a tag (so the model sees the pattern)
- A concrete example WITHOUT a tag (so it knows when NOT to use one)
- Available combo numbers (1=jab, 2=cross, etc.) so it can build custom drills

**Result**: "Suggest me a training" now reliably generates drill cards. Normal conversation stays clean -- no unwanted drill suggestions.

### 7d. Responses using markdown formatting

**Problem**: The model was generating `**bold**`, numbered lists, and headers despite being told not to.

**Fix**: Strengthened the no-markdown instruction to explicitly list every format to avoid: "NEVER use markdown formatting like ** or * or # or numbered lists. Write in plain text only. No bold, no bullet points, no headers."

**Result**: All test responses come back as clean plain text.

### 7e. Image chat not working in live system (missing launch parameter)

**Problem**: Image chat worked in standalone testing but failed when running through the full ROS system. The LLM would respond saying it couldn't see the image.

**Root cause**: The `mmproj_path` ROS parameter was never being passed to the LLM node in the launch files. The node declared the parameter with a default of `""`, and since none of the three launch files set it, `_lazy_load_vision()` always saw an empty path and returned `False`, falling back to text-only mode.

**Fix**: Added `"mmproj_path": str(ws_root / "models" / "llm" / "mmproj-F16.gguf")` to the parameters dict in all three launch files.

**Result**: Vision projector path is now passed to the node at launch. First image request lazy-loads the mmproj and enables vision inference.
